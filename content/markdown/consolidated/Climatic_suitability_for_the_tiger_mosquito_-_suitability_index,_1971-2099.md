Climatic Suitability for the Tiger Mosquito - Suitability Index, 1971-2099
==========================================================================

# Climatic suitability for the tiger mosquito - suitability index

## Main


**Context**
The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) transmits vector-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya. Environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall impact the survival chance and seasonal activity of the tiger mosquito which is a serious threat for human health in Europe.

**Definition**
The climatic suitability index for the presence of the tiger mosquito  is determined by January temperature and annual rainfall statistics. If the January temperature is below 0 °C and the annual rainfall below 500 mm, then the location is not suitable for the mosquito to survive the winter.

**Understand**
A suitability index of 0 indicates that an area is not suitable (has no favourable environmental conditions) for tiger mosquito presence whereas an area with an index of 100 is totally suitable.

**Data Sources**
The tiger mosquito suitability statistics are calculated using bias-adjusted EURO-CORDEX data for two CMIP5 scenarios with different possible future greenhouse gas emissions: RCP4.5 (medium emissions) and RCP8.5 (high emissions). The data covers the period 1971 to 2099 and statistics are averaged for 30 years in overlapping time periods set 10 years apart.  Finally, the time series are averaged for the model ensemble.

**Supporting Information**
The data was collated on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  Further information about this index can be found in the C3S documentation resources in the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-health-vector?tab=overview).

**Visualisation and Navigation**
The climatic suitability index for the tiger mosquito is presented for two CMIP5 scenarios: RCP4.5 with medium greenhouse gas emissions and RCP8.5 with high greenhouse gas emissions.

Statistics for the climatic suitability index of the tiger mosquito are also available via the "Explore in Detail" button as national, sub-national and trans-national area-means for which time series data can be plotted.

**Visualisation and Navigation**
The map shows a 30-year average of the climatic suitability index for the tiger mosquito for the chosen scenario plotted as area means for each region. The EUROSTAT NUTS classification ([Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background)) is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of Europe. The size of the regions shown on the map can be adjusted by selecting the appropriate NUTS level: national level (NUTS-0), first sub-national level (NUTS-1), second sub-national level (NUTS-2), and third sub-national level (NUTS-3).

The regions on the map facilitate dynamic access to the underlying data. Hover the mouse pointer over a region to view the value of the area mean or click on a region to request a time series plot.  Likewise, the trans-national average for the EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA 38) can be accessed via the "Europe" bounding box.

The time series plot shows the ensemble mean and standard deviation (SD) of the suitability index of the climatic suitability responses for the tiger mosquito to the chosen scenario conditions across the EURO-CORDEX regional climate model ensemble. The values represent the centres of a 30-year running average from 1971 to 2100 which results in a time series covering the period from 1986 to 2085.

Click and hover the mouse over the time series plot to view the data values and to reveal action buttons for features such as “zoom” and “download plot as a png”.  Links below the plot enable the download of time series data in the spreadsheet compatible .csv format.
