# Climate Anomaly in the Number of Frost Days

## Main


The number of frost days provides information on frost damage.

A frost day is when the daily minimum temperature is less than 0°C. The climate anomaly in the number of frost days is calculated relative to the 1981–2010 reference period from an ensemble average of 5 global climate model (GCM) simulations for 2 CMIP5 scenarios with different possible future greenhouse gas emissions; RCP2.6 (low emissions) and RCP8.5 (high emissions). The horizontal resolution of the data is 0.5°x0.5°.

A positive anomaly indicates more frost days than the reference period while a negative anomaly indicates fewer frost days than the reference period.

Monthly and annual anomalies of the number of frost days are presented as 30-year means for 2 CMIP5 scenarios; RCP2.6 with low greenhouse gas emissions and RCP8.5 with high greenhouse gas emissions.

Statistics for the number of frost days are also available via the "Explore in Detail" button as national and sub-national area-means for which time series data can be plotted.

The data was collated on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  Further information about this indicator can be found in the C3S documentation resources in the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-agroclimatic-indicators?tab=overview).

A frost day is when the daily minimum temperature is less than 0°C.

The climate anomaly in the number of frost days is calculated relative to the 1981–2010 reference period from an ensemble average of 5 global climate model (GCM) simulations for 2 CMIP5 scenarios with different possible future greenhouse gas emissions; RCP2.6 (low emissions) and RCP8.5 (high emissions).

A positive anomaly indicates more frost days than the reference period while a negative anomaly indicates fewer frost days than the reference period.

The climate anomalies of the monthly and annual number of frost days for the chosen scenario and time period are plotted as area means for each European NUTS region. The EUROSTAT NUTS classification ([Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background)) is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of Europe. The size of the regions shown on the map can be adjusted by selecting the appropriate NUTS level; NUTS-0: Countries, NUTS-1: major socio-economic regions, NUTS-2: basic regions, and NUTS-3: small regions.

The map of NUTS regions facilitates dynamic access to the underlying data. Hover the mouse pointer over a region to view the value of the area mean or click on a region to request a time series plot.

The time series plot shows the ensemble mean and range of frost day responses to the chosen scenario conditions across an ensemble of 5 CMIP5 climate models. Hover the mouse over the time series plot to view the data values.  Click on the plot to reveal the action buttons for features such as “zoom” and “download plot as a png”.

This indicator is expressed as an anomaly from a reference period so a reference climatology is also provided which displays the mean climatology, the standard deviation from the mean, and the 5th and 95th percentiles.

The data was collated on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  Further information about this indicator can be found in the C3S documentation resources in the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-agroclimatic-indicators?tab=overview).
