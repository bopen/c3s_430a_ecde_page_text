# Projected change in monthly and seasonal statistics of daily maximum 2m air temperature

## Main


**Context**
The daily maximum temperature index provides information on long-term climate variability and change. Temperature plays a fundamental role in agricultural productivity, biodiversity and public health.

**Definition**
The daily maximum air temperature (°C) is representative of the temperature at a height of 2m above the surface.  This index provides values for the monthly maximum, monthly minimum, and monthly mean of daily maximum air temperature. The seasonal and annual statistics for this index are averages of these monthly values.

**Data Sources**
Monthly and seasonal statistics of daily maximum 2m surface air temperature are calculated from an ensemble of five global climate model (GCM) simulations for two CMIP5 scenario projections: RCP2.6 (with low greenhouse gas emissions) and RCP8.5 (with high greenhouse gas emissions). Projected changes are calculated relative to a (1981–2010) ERA5 reference period.

**Understand**
A positive value indicates a warmer temperature than the reference period while a negative value indicates a cooler temperature than the reference period.

**Supporting Information**
The data was collated on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  Further information about this index can be found in the C3S documentation resources in the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-agroclimatic-indicators?tab=overview).

**Visualisation and Navigation**
Monthly and seasonal projected changes of the  daily maximum temperature index are presented as 30-year means for each month or season for two CMIP5 scenarios; RCP2.6 with low greenhouse gas emissions and RCP8.5 with high greenhouse gas emissions.

Statistics for the mean value of daily maximum temperature, the maximum value of daily maximum temperature and the minimum value of daily maximum temperature are also available via the "Explore in Detail" button as national, sub-national and trans-national area-means for which time series data can be plotted.

**Visualisation and Navigation**
The projected change in daily maximum temperature statistics for the chosen scenario and time period are plotted as area means for each region. The EUROSTAT NUTS classification ([Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background)) is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of Europe. The size of the regions shown on the map can be adjusted by selecting the appropriate NUTS level: national level (NUTS-0), first sub-national level (NUTS-1), second sub-national level (NUTS-2), and third sub-national level (NUTS-3).

The regions on the map facilitate dynamic access to the underlying data. Hover the mouse pointer over a region to view the value of the area mean or click on a region to request a time series plot.  Likewise, the trans-national average for the EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA 38) can be accessed via the "Europe" bounding box.

The time series plot shows the ensemble mean and range of the temperature responses to the chosen scenario conditions across an ensemble of five CMIP5 climate models. Click and hover the mouse over the time series plot to view the data values and to reveal action buttons for features such as “zoom” and “download plot as a png”.  Links below the plot enable the download of time series data in the spreadsheet compatible .csv format.

This index is expressed as a change relative to a reference period so the (1981-2010) ERA5 reference climatology is also provided. The reference climate contains the mean climatology, the standard deviation from the mean, and the 5th and 95th percentiles.
