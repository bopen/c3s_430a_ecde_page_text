Fire Danger Index - for Comparison with the Australian Mark5 Rating System, 1979-2019
=====================================================================================

# Fire danger index

## Main


**Context**
Fire danger metrics are part of a dataset produced by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) for the [European Forest fire Information System (EFFIS)](https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/about-effis/technical-background/fire-danger-forecast/). The fire danger index allows the EFFIS to be compared with the Australian Mark5 rating system.

**Definition**
The fire danger index is a metric related to the chances of a fire starting, its rate of spread, its intensity, and its difficulty of suppression.  The fire danger index is calculated using the Australian McArthur (Mark 5) rating system. The fire danger model used to produce the dataset is the Global ECMWF Fire Forecast model (GEFF).  The fire danger model takes into account temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, drought conditions, fuel availability, vegetation characteristics and topography.

**Data Sources**
The fire danger index is calculated using weather forecasts from historical simulations provided by the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. 

**Understand**
It is customary to quote a danger class as well as an index number. The fire danger index relates to 6 classes of danger as follows:
0 to 11: low to moderate; 12 to 25: high; 25 to 49: very high.
Thereafter the danger class depends on the type of vegetation, forest or grassland. 
Forest danger classes are: 50 to 75: severe; 75 to 99: extreme; greater than 100: catastrophic.
Grassland danger classes are: 50 to 99: severe; 100 to 149: extreme; greater than 150: catastrophic.

**Supporting Information**
The data was collated on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  Further information about this index can be found in the C3S documentation resources in the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cems-fire-historical?tab=overview).

**Visualisation and Navigation**
The fire danger index based on historical ERA5 Reanalysis data is presented for each month and year from 1979 to 2019.

Historical fire danger index statistics are also available via the "Explore in Detail" button as national, sub-national and trans-national area-means for which time series data can be plotted.

**Visualisation and Navigation**
The annual mean fire danger index for each year from 1979 to 2019 is plotted on a map showing the European NUTS aggregation regions.  The EUROSTAT NUTS classification ([Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background)) is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of Europe. The size of the regions shown on the map can be adjusted by selecting the appropriate NUTS level: national level (NUTS-0), first sub-national level (NUTS-1), and second sub-national level (NUTS-2).

The regions on the map facilitate dynamic access to the underlying data. Hover the mouse pointer over a region to view its name or click on a region to request a time series plot. Likewise, the trans-national average for the EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA 38) can be accessed via the "Europe" bounding box.

The time series plot shows the area mean fire danger index for the chosen region for each month of the chosen year. 

Click and hover the mouse over the time series plot to view the data values and to reveal action buttons for features such as “zoom” and “download plot as a png”.  Links below the plot enable the download of time series data in the spreadsheet compatible .csv format.
