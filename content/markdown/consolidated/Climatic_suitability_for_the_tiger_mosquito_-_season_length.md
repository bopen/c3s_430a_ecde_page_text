# Climatic suitability for the tiger mosquito - season length

## Main


The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) transmits vector-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya. Environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall impact the survival chance and seasonal activity of the tiger mosquito which is a serious threat for human health in Europe.

The season length, in days, of the climatic suitability for the presence of the tiger mosquito is determined by temperature statistics that are calculated either for the season (winter and summer) or for the whole year. The data covers the period 1971 to 2099 and statistics are averaged for 30 years in overlapping time periods set 10 years apart.  Finally, the time series are averaged for the model ensemble.

The season length for tiger mosquito suitability is calculated using bias-adjusted EURO-CORDEX data for 2 CMIP5 scenarios with different possible future greenhouse gas emissions; RCP4.5 (medium emissions) and RCP8.5 (high emissions). The horizontal resolution of the data is 0.1°x0.1°. 

The duration of tiger mosquito presence is also known as the mosquito season. Outside of this period mosquitos die off or go into diapause.

The season length of the climatic suitability for the tiger mosquito is presented for 2 CMIP5 scenarios; RCP4.5 with medium greenhouse gas emissions or RCP8.5 with high greenhouse gas emissions.

Statistics for the season length of the climatic suitability for the tiger mosquito are also available via the "Explore in Detail" button as national and sub-national area-means for which time series data can be plotted.

The data was collated on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  Further information about this indicator can be found in the C3S documentation resources in the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-agroclimatic-indicators?tab=overview).

The season length for tiger mosquito suitability is calculated using bias-adjusted EURO-CORDEX data for 2 CMIP5 scenarios with different possible future greenhouse gas emissions; RCP4.5 (medium emissions) and RCP8.5 (high emissions). The duration of tiger mosquito presence is also known as the mosquito season. Outside of this period mosquitos die off or go into diapause.

The map shows a 30-year average of the season length of the climatic suitability for the tiger mosquito for the chosen scenario plotted as area means for each European NUTS region. The EUROSTAT NUTS classification ([Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background)) is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of Europe. The size of the regions shown on the map can be adjusted by selecting the appropriate NUTS level; NUTS-0: Countries, NUTS-1: major socio-economic regions, NUTS-2: basic regions, and NUTS-3: small regions.

The map of NUTS regions facilitates dynamic access to the underlying data. Hover the mouse pointer over a region to view the value of the area mean or click on a region to request a time series plot.

The time series plot shows the ensemble mean and standard deviation (SD) of the season length of the climatic suitability responses for the tiger mosquito to the chosen scenario conditions across the EURO-CORDEX regional climate model ensemble. The values represent the centres of a 30-year running average from 1971 to 2100 which results in a time series covering the period from 1986 to 2085.
