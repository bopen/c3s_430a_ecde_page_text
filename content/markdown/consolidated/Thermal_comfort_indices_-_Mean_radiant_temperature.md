# Mean Radiant Temperature

## Main


The mean radiant temperature (MRT) and the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) are widely used as human biometeorology parameters to assess the linkages between outdoor environment and human well‐being. These thermal comfort indices describe how the human body experiences atmospheric conditions, specifically air temperature, humidity, wind and radiation. The mean radiant temperature (°C) is a numerical representation of how human beings experience radiation.

The mean radiant temperature (MRT) is based on the principle that the net exchange of radiant energy between objects is approximately proportional to their temperature difference multiplied by their ability to emit and absorb heat (emissivity). In this context the MRT applies to a person in an outdoor environment and is a function of the direct, diffuse and reflected thermal and solar radiation they experience. 

The mean radiant temperature (MRT) is computed using solar and thermal data from the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis and is part of the ERA5-HEAT (Human thErmAl comforT) dataset.  The horizontal resolution of the data is 0.25°x0.25°. 

The mean radiant temperature (MRT) based on the ERA5-HEAT dataset is presented for each month and year from 1979 to 2019.

MRT statistics are also available via the "Explore in Detail" button as national and sub-national area-means for which time series data can be plotted.

The data was collated on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  Further information about this indicator can be found in the C3S documentation resources in the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/derived-utci-historical?tab=overview).

The mean radiant temperature (MRT) for each month and year from 1979 to 2019 is plotted on a map showing the European NUTS regions. The EUROSTAT NUTS classification ([Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background)) is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of Europe. The size of the regions shown on the map can be adjusted by selecting the appropriate NUTS level; NUTS-0: Countries, NUTS-1: major socio-economic regions and NUTS-2: basic regions.

The map of NUTS regions facilitates dynamic access to the underlying data. Hover the mouse pointer over a region to view its name or click on a region to request a time series plot.

The time series plot shows the area mean MRT for the chosen NUTS region.  Hover the mouse over the time series plot to view the data values.  Click on the plot to reveal the action buttons for features such as “zoom” and “download plot as a png”.
