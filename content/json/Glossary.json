        "Explanation": "The apparent temperature is a measure of the temperature percieved by humans. At high temperatures it is a measure of the relative discomfort due to combined heat and high humidity and is calculated from a combination of air temperature and dew point temperature.  At low temperatures it is calcuated as a combination of air temperature and wind speed and is known as wind chill.",
