Tidal dynamics, and sea level change data from climate models are taken into account in the calculation of this index. Storm surges caused by atmospheric forcing are not taken into account for this index.\n\n**Data Sources**\nThe data covers the period from 2070 to 2100 based on CMIP5 scenario RCP4.5 with medium greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe index is generated using the Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM, Deltares) and the Wave Model (WAM, ECMWF). High resolution forcing fields for the GTSM are provided by the Danish Meteorological Institute's regional model (HIRHAM5) which is downscaled from the EC-EARTH global climate model.\n\nThe EC-EARTH simulations used input from a relative Sea Surface Height (SSH) dataset that takes into account geophysical drivers of long-term SSH change, such as changes to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, thermal expansion of the ocean, and glacial isostatic adjustment.\n\nGiven that the projections of these climate scenarios are based on a single combination of the regional and global climate models, users of these data should take into consideration that there is an inevitable underestimation of the uncertainty associated with this dataset.\n\n**Supporting Information**\nThe data was collated on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  Further information about this index can be found in the C3S documentation resources in the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-water-level-change-indicators?tab=overview).\n\n***\n\n**Visualisation and Navigation**\nThe projected change in mean relative sea level is presented for the future period 2070-2100 based on CMIP5 scenario RCP4.5 with medium greenhouse gas emissions."
